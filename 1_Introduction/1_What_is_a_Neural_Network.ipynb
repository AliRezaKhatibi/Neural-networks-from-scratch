    "## **1. Introduction to Neural Networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Neural Network** is a computational model inspired by the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (called neurons) that work together to solve specific problems, such as classification, regression, or pattern recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of a Neural Network:\n",
    "1. **Input Layer:** Receives the input data.\n",
    "2. **Hidden Layers:** Perform computations and extract features.\n",
    "3. **Output Layer:** Produces the final result (e.g., a prediction).\n",
    "4. **Weights and Biases:** Parameters that the network learns during training.\n",
    "5. **Activation Functions:** Introduce non-linearity into the model (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid).\n",

    "\n",
    "## **2. Why Use Neural Networks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are powerful because:\n",
    "- They can learn complex patterns in data.\n",
    "- They are highly flexible and can be applied to various tasks (e.g., image recognition, natural language processing).\n",
    "- They perform well with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Applications of Neural Networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are used in many fields, including:\n",
    "- **Computer Vision:** Image classification, object detection.\n",
    "- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Text generation, sentiment analysis.\n",
    "- **Healthcare:** Disease diagnosis, drug discovery.\n",
    "- **Finance:** Stock price prediction, fraud detection.\n",
