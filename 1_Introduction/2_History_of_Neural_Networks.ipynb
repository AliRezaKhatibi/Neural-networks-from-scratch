    "# History of Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the history and evolution of neural networks, from their early beginnings to the modern advancements in deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Early Beginnings (1940s - 1950s)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1943: McCulloch and Pitts Neuron**\n",
    "- **Warren McCulloch** and **Walter Pitts** proposed the first mathematical model of a neural network, known as the **McCulloch-Pitts Neuron**.\n",
    "- This model was inspired by the functioning of biological neurons and could perform simple logical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1958: Perceptron**\n",
    "- **Frank Rosenblatt** introduced the **Perceptron**, an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers.\n",
    "- The Perceptron was the first model capable of learning weights for input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. The First AI Winter (1960s - 1970s)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1969: Limitations of Perceptrons**\n",
    "- **Marvin Minsky** and **Seymour Papert** published the book *\"Perceptrons\"*, highlighting the limitations of single-layer Perceptrons.\n",
    "- They proved that Perceptrons could not solve problems that were not linearly separable (e.g., XOR problem).\n",
    "- This led to a decline in interest in neural networks, known as the **AI Winter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Revival and Multi-Layer Networks (1980s - 1990s)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1986: Backpropagation**\n",
    "- **Rumelhart**, **Hinton**, and **Williams** popularized the **Backpropagation** algorithm, which allowed training of multi-layer neural networks.\n",
    "- Backpropagation enabled neural networks to solve complex, non-linear problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1989: Universal Approximation Theorem**\n",
    "- **George Cybenko** and **Kurt Hornik** proved that a neural network with a single hidden layer and sufficient neurons could approximate any continuous function.\n",
    "- This theorem provided a theoretical foundation for the power of neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1990s: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**\n",
    "- **Yann LeCun** developed **LeNet**, one of the first successful convolutional neural networks, for handwritten digit recognition.\n",
    "- CNNs became a breakthrough in computer vision tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. The Deep Learning Revolution (2000s - Present)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2006: Deep Belief Networks**\n",
    "- **Geoffrey Hinton** introduced **Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)**, which marked the beginning of the **Deep Learning** era.\n",
    "- DBNs used unsupervised pre-training to initialize weights, making it possible to train deeper networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2012: AlexNet**\n",
    "- **Alex Krizhevsky**, **Ilya Sutskever**, and **Geoffrey Hinton** developed **AlexNet**, a deep convolutional neural network that won the ImageNet competition by a large margin.\n",
    "- AlexNet popularized the use of GPUs for training deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2014: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**\n",
    "- **Ian Goodfellow** introduced **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, which revolutionized the field of generative models.\n",
    "- GANs consist of two networks (generator and discriminator) that compete against each other to produce realistic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2017: Transformers**\n",
    "- **Vaswani et al.** introduced the **Transformer** architecture, which became the foundation for state-of-the-art models in natural language processing (e.g., BERT, GPT).\n",
